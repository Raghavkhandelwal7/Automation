Tasks that take my time doing manually and use up my time:- 

1: Making account of stuff like , for example i have to record the marks/point's for a given test hypothetically.(Even with databases this still takes a long time)

2:  Mopping the floor of the house.(sadly i cant automate this )

3: Online shooping what i do for my mom sometimes. (cant automate this either)

4: Reading the class project document :p 

5: Opening an application :)

The task that i selected to automate the most is number 1: Making account of stuff

The steps required to do this is: 

1: Open an application or a website
2: Define the name and the table
3: Entering the text,numbers,etc manually and type it out (this takes the longest time)

My workflow that will reduce time accordingly is by instead of typing everything put manually (the data) i will add a speech to text converter so that its easier to store the large amounts of data for the people who are not fast at typing or are new to computer therby reducing time used manually spent on typing everything out manually


The things required for this is a speech to text converter and a database

(If this task cannot be automated by things i have learnt so far then i can think of another task to automate. let me know)
